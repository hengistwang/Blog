At first this book talk about elements of programming is interesting
+ primitive expressions
+ means of combination
+ means of abstraction
in this book we are gonna use scheme language, and i use chicken interpreter, just because i like it's interesting name.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
this language use prefix notation like this
(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
name something like value
(define size 2)
this associate the value 2 with the name size

define procedure
(define (suqare x) (* x x))
or
(define square (lambda (x) (* x x))
this is some kind of syntactic sugar, but the lambda type is more essential.

a good question asked at the end of first class, what's the difference between the following two expressions
(define a (* 5 5 ))
(define (b) (* 5 5))
 a  ==> 25
(a) ==> Error: call of non-procedure: 25
 b  ==> #<procedure (b)>
(b) ==> 25
#+END_SRC
